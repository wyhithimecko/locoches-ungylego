 What is phonics?
 
 Phonics is a way of teaching children to read by understanding the sounds that individual letters make and blending them to make a word. Children can learn to read using this skill to decode new words. Phonic Books specializes in publishing decodable, systematic books supporting this structured literacy instruction.
