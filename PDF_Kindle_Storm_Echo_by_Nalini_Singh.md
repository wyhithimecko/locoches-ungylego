Overview
New York Times bestselling author Nalini Singh takes us into the hearts of two fractured people in a world on the brink of a psychic ArmageddonÂ .Â .Â .

 Silence has fallen. The Psy are free to feel emotion. Free to love. But Silence was never a prison for Ivan Mercant. The biggest threat to his future lies dormant in his brainâ€”a psychic monster that wants only to feed. And now, the brutal leash heâ€™s kept on that monster is slipping. He prepared for this day, for the end of Ivan MercantÂ .Â .Â . but that was before he met Lei.
 Â 
 As primal as she is human, this wild changeling brings color into his life, laughter to his soul. Then the dream shatters in a rain of blood, in silent bodies in the snow. Lei is gone. Vanished without a traceÂ .Â .Â . until he meets strangely familiar eyes across a busy San Francisco street.
 Â 
 Soleil Bijoux Garcia is a healer who has lost everything. She exists in a world of desolate alonenessÂ .Â .Â . till the day she finds herself face-to-face with a lethal stranger. The animal who is her other half knows this man, but her memories are tattered fragments. Sorrow and a need for vengeance are all that drive her. Her mission? To kill the alpha of the DarkRiver leopard pack.
 Â 
 But fate has other plans. Soon, a deadly soldier who believes himself a monster and a broken healer might be all that stand between life and death for the entire Psy race.Â .Â .Â .
