Overview
Takashi Natsume has always been aware of the supernatural world, but after he inherits a magical book from his grandmother, the supernatural world is aware of him!
 
 Takashi Natsume can see the spirits and demons that hide from the rest of humanity. He has always been set apart from other people because of his gift, drifting from relative to relative, never fitting in. Now he is a troubled high school student who has come to live in the small town where his grandmother grew up. And there he discovers that he has inherited more than just the Sight from the mysterious Reiko.
 
 Natsume receives a secondhand invitation to a gathering of antiques dealers and afficionados. The event, however, is no mundane auction, and the guest list is filled with friends and foes alike. When the whole building is locked down after a theft is discovered, Natsume must rally his allies before his enemies make their move!
