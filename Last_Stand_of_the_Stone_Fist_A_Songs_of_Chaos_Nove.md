A troubled past. War in the present. A dark future. Brode grew up a bastard in Athra, looked down upon as a child of chaos. Sent away to the dragon riders as a squire, Brode counted it his luckiest day when Silas Brightbark of Coedhen vouched for him to join their ranks. Now a Champion in the Order he faces the largest incursion the world has ever seen. Sent on a far flung mission to the Disputed Lands, Brode and Silas discover a remote town not on any map. It&amp;#039;s a town of outcasts, of broken people, of folk that order has forgotten. As a scourge swarm gathers nearby, Brode and Silas face the toughest fight and decision of their lives. This print edition also includes a bonus second novella called The Huntress set in the world of my first trilogy, The Dragon&amp;#039;s Blade. There are also map images of both series, as well some concept sketches for The Dragon&amp;#039;s Blade.
