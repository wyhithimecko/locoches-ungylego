Ruth Markel‚Äôs tenacious fight for justice on behalf of the murder of her son, Dan Markel, and the struggle to be legally reunited with her grandchildren.

 Ruth Markel is the mother of the late Dan Markel, a noted law professor who was murdered in Tallahassee, Florida in 2014.

 In The Unveiling, she describes her experiences since the day of Dan‚Äôs death from several distinct perspectives:
As a devastated mother with the unique human perspective of becoming a homicide survivor and victim. As a woman whose attempts to achieve normalcy and live a healthy life are continually interrupted by painful reminders, a rollercoaster of hearings, frequently changing trial dates, verdicts, and appeals. As an engaged citizen using what she has learned to help other victims of homicide and violent crimes recover from trauma and begin an optimistic outlook on life. As an insider who shows how our collective network of family, friends, and experts‚Äîincluding a murder coach‚Äîhave helped her family remain involved, motivated, and hopeful. As a grandmother who had not been allowed to see her grandchildren in many years, she used advocacy to inspire the Florida State Legislature to pass a grandparent visitation bill. And as an experienced author of nine books using the written word to effectively address the shift from grief to promise.
