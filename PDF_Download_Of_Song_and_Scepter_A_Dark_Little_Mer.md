She&amp;#039;s a killer in disguise. He&amp;#039;s determined to make her his queen. As a deep sea death-dealer, Enna Valomir&amp;#039;s life is simple: kill the siren, deliver the body, collect the reward. There&amp;#039;s just one problem. Enna owes a mermaid her life, and in the cutthroat waters of the Abyss, that&amp;#039;s a lifelong blood oath of service. When the mermaid orders her to kill the Abyssal Princess, Enna is pulled into an impersonation scheme with no choice but to infiltrate a gaudy surface court and help the mermaid win the heart-and throne-of its unwitting future king. But Prince Soren isn&amp;#039;t interested in courting the so-called Abyssal Princess, or any power-hungry princess, for that matter. He&amp;#039;s finally met his match in her fierce and mysterious handmaid, and he&amp;#039;ll be damned if he can&amp;#039;t have Enna for his queen instead. Breaking a blood oath means death, but Enna falls for Soren anyway. Now she must watch him descend into a ruin of her own making, or warn him of the ruse-and die. Part of the Sirens of Adria dark fantasy romance series, Of Song and Scepter is a standalone little mermaid retelling intended for mature audiences.
