Inspire kids with the glittering story of pop superstar Taylor Swift! This talented singerâ€“songwriter started as a little country girl with a big dream to become a star.
 Â 
 Little Taylor grew up on her familyâ€™s Christmas tree farm in Pennsylvania. Then, at age six, she went to her first concert â€“ she saw LeAnn Rimes, the country musician. At that moment, Taylor fell in love with country music! Some of the kids at school didnâ€™t understand but Taylor managed to shake it off!
 Â 
 She took her first steps towards stardom by recording a demo of cover songs and sent it to record labels in Nashville, the home of country music. However, while, she enjoyed singing others&#039; songs, she knew all too well that she had to express herself in her own words. So, she started writing her own lyrics and melodies and her natural talent for putting her feelings into words shone through.
 Â 
 After signing with a record label, she started working on her first album. Called &#039;Taylor Swift&#039;, it became very popular, very quickly. She earned a number one single on the country music charts.
 Â 
 Then, she released her second album, &#039;Fearless&#039;, which was country-pop instead of just country and suddenly, everyone knew her name. She won a Grammy for her work and started to write more and more pop music for her albums. She wrote heartfelt lyrics loved by millions around the world.
 Â 
 Despite the obstacles in her way, Taylor has always stood up for what she believes in, and always believes in herself!
